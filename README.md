### **Soft Actor Critic for Continuous 3D Motion Control in Wireless Autonomous Networks**


This is the implementation of the Vanilla SAC algorithm proposed in the paper entitled "Deep Actor-Critic for Continuous 3D Motion Control in Mobile Relay Networks" in PyTorch. The paper is submitted to ICASSP 2022. The Environment.py and the helper_functions.py files are implemented based on code from Anastasios Dimas
